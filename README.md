# Third-Eye-For-Blind

#Third eye for people who are blind is an innovation which helps the blind people to navigate with speed and confidence by detecting the nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and notify them with buzzer sound or vibration. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth.
#The aim of the project is to develop a cheap and more efficient way to help visually impaired to navigate with greater comfort, speed and confidence.
